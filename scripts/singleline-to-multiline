### multiline: a file with non-empty lines followed by an empty line (e.g. VW's *ldf format and CoNLL*)
###            runs of lines between empty lines are called 'instances'
### singleline: many instances on a single line, deliminated by a given separator like '|||'
###             this format is unix-friendly (things like shuf, sort, grep, etc)

# Use case: You want to shuffle some VW ldf training instances:
# $ SEP="|||"
# $ multiline-to-singleline train.ldf /dev/stdout $SEP | shuf | singleline-to-multiline /dev/stdin train.shuf.ldf $SEP
