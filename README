1. We use Java7
2. Framenet database contains the following files 
   (the xsl files are just stylesheets)
   (The schema folder contains all schemas)
   (The meat is in the directories)
   | Directory | Index xml      | XSD                             |                                                                                                                                                                   |

   Corresponding to xsd definitions there are xml files.

   | luIndex.xml       | This contains the LU and its related frame. The LU is always the trigger |
   | semTypes.xml      |                                             |
