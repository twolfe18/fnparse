To compile a bunch of stuff (in particular pacaya) you will need
a script that sets up a SSH tunnel to the Maven repositories on the CLSP network:
  ssh -f -N -L 8081:checker:8081 -2 login.clsp.jhu.edu




1. We use Java7
2. Framenet database contains the following files 
   (the xsl files are just stylesheets)
   (The schema folder contains all schemas)
   (The meat is in the directories)

3. The usage of this requires System.getProperty("toydataPath"). toydatapath is the path to the toydata folder.
