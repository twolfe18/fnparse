To compile a bunch of stuff (in particular pacaya) you will need
a script that sets up a SSH tunnel to the Maven repositories on the CLSP network:
  ssh -f -N -L 8081:checker:8081 -2 login.clsp.jhu.edu




1. We use Java7
2. Framenet database contains the following files

      The annoset 1950929 is 
      luID.xml

   Frame names start with capital letter (note that frames are referred to by names and lu by ids)

3. The usage of this requires System.getProperty("toydataPath"). toydatapath is the path to the toydata folder.
4. The toydata/nw/wsj/00/wsj_0001.prd file was created from the folder /export/corpora/LDC/LDC99T42/treebank_3/parsed/prd/wsj/00/wsj_0001.prd . The semlink.1.2.2c file actually says their extension to be .parse we handle this in code
5. There is a discrepancy in semlink data. basically the triggerIndex is broken (it says 14 when it should be 12)
   the problem is in line 8 of semlink which corresponds to line 13 of probank
   they can be accessed as 
   $head -n 8 data/semlink/1.2.2c.okay | tail -n  1
   nw/wsj/00/wsj_0003.parse 2 14 gold make-v 26.1-1 Manufacturing make.01 null ----- 3:2*12:1*13:1-ARG0=Agent;Manufacturer 14:0-rel 15:1-ARG1=Product;Product 3:2*12:1-LINK-SLC 
   and $head -n 7 data/semlink/1.2.2c.okay | tail -n  1
   nw/wsj/00/wsj_0003.parse 1 31 gold say-v 37.7-1 IN say.01 null ----- 0:3*33:1-ARG1=Topic 30:1-ARG0=Agent 31:0-rel 
    wsj/00/wsj_0003.mrg      2 12 
    nw/wsj/00/wsj_0003.parse 2 14 
   I could use propbank's trigger index instead though as the default. the following commands can easily help me find out the correspondence between the two files. 
   cat data/propbank/propbank_1/data/prop.txt > propbank_data
   cat data/semlink/1.2.2c.okay | cut -c 4- > semlink_data
   while read line ; do arr=($line) && echo ${arr[0]} ${arr[1]} ${arr[2]}  ; done < semlink_data > semlink_3col
   while read line ; do arr=($line) && echo ${arr[0]} ${arr[1]} ${arr[2]}  ; done < propbank_data > propbank_3col
   sed "s#.parse #_#" semlink_3col > semlink_3
   sed "s#.mrg #_#" propbank_3col > propbank_3
